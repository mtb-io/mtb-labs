# 🧪 mtb labs

Building weird and useful things at the edge of AI, Web3, and Discord.

We’re not chasing hype. We’re building infrastructure for the agentic economy, bots that think, dashboards that adapt, and systems that learn. Quietly. Efficiently. Automatically.

## 🧠 Core Project: Odin

The engine behind everything. Odin is an AI layer that routes context, handles memory, adapts personas, and knows when to shut up.

It powers:
- **prism** — Discord analytics with actual intelligence
- **aegis** — Smart moderation with memory
- **nexus** — Web3-native Discord verification with token gating
- **freya** — AI-powered routines for families (and neurodiverse kids)
- **loki** — Narrative intelligence for navigating alpha

And soon:
- **Bifrost** — A sentient wallet with multiple personas (yes, really. well, maybe...)

## 📡 What's Live

| Project | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **prism** | Private Beta | Real-time Discord insights with sentiment and predictive analytics |
| **nexus** | Building | Web3 wallet verification and NFT role assignment |
| **freya** | Alpha | Routine builder + XP system for kids, gamified with AI |
| **odin core API** | Live | Multimodal agent layer with model routing, Redis caching, and persona logic |
| **DexScope** | Building | AI meets DEXTools: live token signals, gas insights, and real-time alerts |

## 🧭 Philosophy

We don’t just ask _what can this model say?_

We ask:
- What **should** it say?
- To **whom**?
- And when should it just shut up?

Context-aware AI. Agentic infrastructure. Rea time relevance.
