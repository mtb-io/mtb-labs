# 🧪 mtb labs

Building weird and useful things at the edge of AI, Web3, and Discord.

We’re not chasing hype. We’re laying rails for the agentic economy — bots that think, dashboards that adapt, systems that learn. Quietly. Efficiently. Automatically.

## 🧠 Core Project: Odin

The engine behind the chaos. Odin is an AI cognition layer that routes context, adapts personas, handles memory, and knows when to keep quiet.

**Now integrated with Irys + Arweave.** Verifiable memory. Programmable data. Context that lasts.

It powers:
- **prism** — Discord analytics with actual intelligence
- **aegis** — Smart moderation with memory
- **nexus** — Web3-native Discord verification + token gating
- **freya** — AI-powered habits for families and neurodiverse kids
- **loki** — Narrative intelligence for navigating alpha
- **thor** — Security & infra sentinel
- **nina** — Adult accountability companion

Coming soon:
- **bifrost** — A sentient wallet with multiple personalities. Slightly unstable. Fully sovereign.

## 🧭 Philosophy

We don’t just ask _what can this model say?_

We ask:
- What **should** it say?
- To **whom**?
- When should it shut up?
- And what should it **never forget**?

Agentic systems. Real-time context. Behaviour-aware memory.  
The boring bits that make AI actually useful.
